I am creating this project as an example of an improved website for Taste of Thailand. I will be using HTML and CSS to create a website 
containing three pages. A home page, a menu page and a table booking page.

## Wireframes

My wireframes were made using Justinminds. You can view them [here](assets/readme-documents/thai-wireframes.pdf).

 ## UX
 
 This website has been created for customers who enjoy Taste of Thailands food and people looking to eat out or order home deliveries of thai cuisine. website will be a simple to use and attractive website for customers that want to look through the menu, find out contact details or book a table at Taste of Thailand.  

 ![menu items](/assets/readme-documents/menuitems.png)

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website is.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the restaurant has.
 * As a user I can use phone number and email links to open necessary ways of contacting the restaurant.
 * As a user I can navigate myself through to the menu and contact page through links provided.
 * As a user I can view various menu items.
 * As a user I can view and enlarge the menus so I can see items I would like to order
 * As a user I can fill out a booking form so that I can book a table.
 
## Existing Features

 * A navigation bar allowing users to scroll through the various pages.
 * Social links opening the associated web pages in a new window.
 * A small selection of menu items with photos price etc.
 * Menus with transitions that enlarge when hovered over.
 * A booking form for customers to book tables.
 * Various functioning links to socials, email, phone number and bookings.

 ### Features left to implement

 If this was the website for the actual restaurant it would be good to implement an API to google maps, a gallery, ensure that the booking form funtioned and possibly add a contact form

## Testing

Having written my code for each .html page I have validated them on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The same applies to my css which I have validated on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

1. Navbar
* Going through each of the pages, I clicked on each navigation bar link to ensure all pages worked individually.

2. Social Media links
- I went to the social media links on each of the pages and clicked on them to ensure they opened up in new tabs using 'target="_blank"'.

3. Telephone and email links
- I checked that the links opened in either the telephone app or email app, respectively

4. Menu images
- I checked whether the menu images enlarged correctly without overflowing over the page on a range of different device sizes

5. Booking form
- I checked the Booking form was responsive. It is not linked to an email of a way of booking currently.

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, having
tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphones, a macbook
and desktop.
